# Sustainable and Circular Textiles

- Global textiles production almost doubled between 2000 and 2015
- Consumption of clothing and footwear is expected to increase by 63% by 2030, from 62 million tonnes now to 102 million tonnes in 2030
- Consumption of textiles, most of which are imported, now accounts on average for the fourth highest negative impact on the environment and on climate change and third highest for water and land use from a global life cycle perspective
- About 5.8 million tonnes of textiles are discarded every year in the EU, approximately 11kg per person 4 , and every second somewhere in the world a truckload of textiles is landfilled or incinerated
